# ODI Learning Management System

Source code to the ODI Learning Management system

Currently an un-pretty beta version created as a minimum viable product to help track the reach of ODI learning courses, both online and face-to-face.

The system requires a large mongodb instance and is tied to scorm reporting of eLearning.

## Deploying 

Full instructions to come at some point however this was created from the php-getting-started heroku app.
